            I would rather not go
            Back to the old house
            I would rather not go
            Back to the old house
            There's too many bad memories
            Too many memories
            When you cycled by, here began all my dreams
            The saddest thing I've ever seen
            And you never knew
            How much I really liked you
            Because I never even told you
            Oh, and I meant to
            Are you still there?
            Or have you moved away?
            Or have you moved away?
            I would love to go
            Back to the old house
            But I never will
            I never will, I never will
            I never will
